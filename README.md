I am stuck here, this is not working:
we need to add condition in loop. 
If image and classification is chosen , promt upload image button and after uploaded (check if uploaded or not) submit to run the image prediction/classification.
While text and summerization is chosed, promt to enter text and display output, if image and summerization is chosen, we'll prompt to upload image and display the output as summary. 
let's remove audio from the input type.
